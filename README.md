## First steps of a drone

This repository holds the first steps to control a drone using ROS and specially MAVROS. This repository doesn't contain all the files to run the simulations or the real project. This project it is based on other open sources codes and in this README it will be explained how to have the environment to run it. 

The aim of this project is to finally run a real drone who will travel a little distance in an autonomous form. The real drone will be an hexacopter but the simulation will work in a quadcopter. 

## Advandrone Team

* Miguel LÃ³pez Delgado: miguel.lopez04@estudiant.upf.edu 
* Teacher - ask if it is possible to write the name

## Environment installation

This repository contains code supported on the following installation:

* Install ROS Melodic following the steps included in this [webpage](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)
* Follow the steps of [GAAS](https://gaas.gitbook.io/guide/software-realization-build-your-own-autonomous-drone/build-your-own-autonomous-drone-e01-offboard-control-and-gazebo-simulation) (we will change files of this environment in order to make our properly simulations. 
  * Skip the installation of ROS Melodic 
  * Skip the point 2. Using Docker

## Material

* 1 PC - With Linux 18.04 
* 1 - [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) where we will install Linux 18.04
* 1 - [Raspberry](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* 6 - proppellers
* 6 - ESC
* 1 - battery
* 1 - drone base
* 6 - motors

## catkin_ws

The files included in this directory have to be included in the GAAS project we have downloaded before. There are new files and there are files that have been changed. Take care to have the new files instead the older ones. 

## listener

This directory doesn't need to be downloaded in an exact directory, but there is a file which is mandatory to put the propertly path of the Firmware in the catkin workspace. 

* Modify the file listener.cc in order to have the correct path in your environment.
