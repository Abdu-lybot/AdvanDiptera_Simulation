# Second simulation
## First movements autonomosly 

In this simulation we will make the drone to go to a random position where there is no obstacle detected. So the drone will choose one of the four directions that the movement it is not blocked.

The code is very similar to the first simulation. You can see the changes in the **commander.py** and in the **px4_mavros_run.py** files.
